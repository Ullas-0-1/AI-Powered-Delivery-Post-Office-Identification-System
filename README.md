# Smart-Pincode-Validation-and-Correction
The "Smart-Pincode-Validation-and-Correction" enhances postal operations by validating addresses and ensuring accurate pincodes. It first checks the provided address, identifies the nearest post office, and validates the pincode. If the pincode matches the correct region, it's accepted; if not, the system replaces it with the actual pincode of the nearest post office. The system also supports handwritten and voice-based address inputs, parses them into structured data, and stores incorrect pincode entries for further review, improving overall postal accuracy.
